      <h2>Normal Clicking</h2>
      <p>Honestly this is just the normal way to click. Some people do well with this, and others don't. You can do this on any mouse with any setup and it's what most people do. You just left click repeatedly with your index finger</p>

      <h2>Butterfly Clicking</h2>
      <p>This method of clicking is faster than normal clicking. You click your left mouse button with both your index and middle fingers, alternating them with each click. You can do this with most mouses on any setup.</p>

      <h2>Jitter Clicking</h2>
      <p>This method of clicking is also faster than normal clicking. Some people prefer this method, and some prefer the other method. It's really up to you to decide. You can jitter click by optionally tensing your arm, then shaking your wrist up and down and clicking with each shake.</p>

      <h2>Drag Clicking</h2>
      <p>This method of clicking is by far the fastest method of clicking. Many people use this method to reach very high CPS numbers. This method of clicking works better on specific mouses. Drag clicking is just dragging your finger over your mouse. It relies on friction between your finger and the mouse button and it also relies on the weight of your hand against the mouse. Drag clicking relies on the same principles as drawing a dotted line on a chalkboard.</p>
